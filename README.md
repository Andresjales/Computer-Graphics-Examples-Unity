## Before you start
Because of copyright reasons I cannot share the majority of the extra packages I'm using in this project. However, this project has its own dependency checker tool so you can download the packages yourself.

To use this tool you'll need to:

* Go to `Window/Non Publishable Dependencies`
* Click on `Refresh`
* Click on `Download`
* download the package from the asset store for each package that shows up in RED
